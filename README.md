### Page replacement algorithms
A program that implements the FIFO and LRU page-replacement algorithms. These two replacement algorithms are implemented so that the number of page frames can vary from 1 to 7. The program takes three arguments: the algorithm to use, a reference-string file, and the number of frames; and produces one output: the number of page faults.

Note: To test this program, provide a reference-string file whose format is one page number per line.
